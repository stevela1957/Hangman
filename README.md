# Hangman
My take on Hangman, using Tech with Tim's screenshot as inspiration

I am a beginning 'Student' using pygame.  I look at the polished pros projects and just based on the initial screenshot and description, 
attempt to make a working game.  This is a functional program, but has some issues.  

#1: I had to slow it to 10 FPS to ensure it did not register multiple mouse clicks and add duplicate body parts to the gallows
#2: The positions of the letter buttons is sensed by mouse x,y position.  This is not perfect yet.  Working on dialing this in
#3: Haven't figured out yet how to create the inner loop to allow a new game to be started.  Again, working on it

I do recommend subscriving to Tech with Tim's channel.  He explains well and has several great pygame projects!
